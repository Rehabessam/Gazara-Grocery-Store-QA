# Gazara Grocery Store – Manual QA Project 🛒

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **manual software testing project** for an e-commerce grocery website called **Gazara Grocery Store**.  
The project was created as part of a **QA Testing Bootcamp** and focuses on **requirement-based testing** using **Jira Scrum** and **Zephyr Scale**.

The application under test is **conceptual** (requirements-based), and all QA artifacts were designed based on documented requirements rather than a live system.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze business requirements and user needs
- Create Epics and User Stories using Jira Scrum
- Design high-level test scenarios
- Write detailed manual test cases
- Maintain full traceability between requirements and test cases
- Organize test cycles and data sets using Zephyr Scale

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Jira Scrum** – Requirements management (Epics & User Stories)
- **Zephyr Scale** – Test management (Test Cases, Test Cycles, Data Sets)
- **Microsoft Excel** – Test case documentation
- **GitHub** – Version control and project portfolio

## 📘 Requirements Coverage
The project includes the following **Epics**:
- User Authentication & Registration (Signup & Login)
- Navigation & Website Structure
- Shopping Cart Management
- Checkout & Delivery
- Payment Processing (Card & Cash on Delivery Rules)

Each Epic contains multiple **User Stories** with:
- Clear descriptions
- Acceptance criteria
- Priority and sprint assignment
- Preserved Jira IDs (e.g., GGS-1, GSS-3) for traceability

---

## 🧪 Test Design Approach
- **High-Level Test Scenarios** were created for each Epic
- **Manual Test Cases** were written in detail and organized by feature
- **Data Sets** were defined in Zephyr Scale to support data-driven testing
- **Test Cycles** were created in Zephyr to logically group test cases

⚠️ **Note:**  
This project does **not include live test execution**.  
Test cases and test cycles were designed **based on requirements only**, as no real application was available for execution.
